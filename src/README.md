# Filtering in rust
This is a repository for a side project of my dissertation. Currently supports a gui file dialog to open a .tdms file with an appropriate folder naming convention.

## Future work 
- [ ] Adding simple filtering support for `butterworth` I.I,R. filter.
- [ ] Make some ui for configuring the filter.
