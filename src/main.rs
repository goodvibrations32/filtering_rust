/// have a first layer of information about what
/// the user needs to do. The message appearing in the
/// screen could look different  but the
/// text should be identical in all OS's.
/// ## Choices
/// - Yes :
///     The channel with name "Wind2" will be
///     plotted if it contains any data.
/// - No :
///     There will be displayied some information
///     about any found channel that could be parsed
///     and in the chosen `.tdms` file.
